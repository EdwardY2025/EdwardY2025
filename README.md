# 👋 Hi, I'm Edward Yeboah

I'm a recent graduate of **Stony Brook University**, where I earned a **Bachelor of Science in Technological Systems Management** with a specialization in **Computer Science**.

I’m interested in software development, scripting, databases, and building practical tools that help people work smarter.

This GitHub profile is a collection of my personal projects and experiments in automation, data management, and software design.
